<h3>Using the Drill-Down Feature</h3>
<p>
The drill-down feature allows you to click on a map region and
receive information related to that region, generally in the form
of a new Web page. For example, if you click on the state
of Illinois in a map of the United States, you could be given a
new Web page that contains a bar graph of employment demographics 
for that state.
<p>
The way that a map responds to drill-down actions varies 
depending on the drill-down mode that was implemented when the map was 
generated. 
<p>
The drill-down capability does not have to be implemented for all of
the regions in this map. Clicking on a region that does not have 
drill-down capability simply selects that region.
